# Leaflet Challenge
# 
## Tools Used:
### D3.js
### leaflet.js
# 
## Objectives: 
### Import data from USGS via API call
### Visualize earthquake data by magnitude with legend
# 
## Challenges:
#### The main challenge faced with this project was in finding how to accomplish certain visualizations within the Leaflet documentation. While the documentation is very good for the most part, certain aspects of this project required creative solutions to be fulfilled, which were not as apparent in the documentation. Implementing the code was fairly straightforward, but required some modification of the code samples available within the documentation.

## Opportunities for Improvement:
#### Overall, the visualizations tell the story of the data in an easy to understand way, but do not necessarily maximize the amount of insights that can be obtained from the dataset. The main improvement that could be made would be in the representation of the data, as well as the interactability of the visualizations. Additionally, only one dataset was utilized, so pulling in additional data could allow for a more compelling story to be told surrounding the data.
